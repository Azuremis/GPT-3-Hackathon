# GPT-3 Legal Statement Summariser

## How to use
This prototype is hosted on streamlit [here](https://azuremis-legal-summariser-interface-f6nzl8.streamlitapp.com/).

It summarises terms of service which usually come with any online service.

To use, you will first need an OpenAI API key for GPT3. You can sign up for one 
[here](https://openai.com/api/). It's free :)

After pasting in your API key, simply input a short paragraph from a
terms of service agreement and voila, you will have a simpler version of the main 
points.

This is a demo so I don't advise using it for any serious purpose!
